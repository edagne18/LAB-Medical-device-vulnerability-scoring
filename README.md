# Vulnerability Scoring Calculator

This project is a web-based Vulnerability Scoring Calculator that allows users to evaluate potential risks and vulnerabilities by selecting various metrics. The calculator uses different categories to generate a score based on user input.

## Description

The Vulnerability Scoring Calculator is designed to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for calculating the overall score of vulnerabilities by choosing from a set of predefined options. The calculator factors in key metrics like attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, user interaction, and more to generate a final score. The result can help in assessing the severity of vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page layout and includes the scoring interface.
- `calculator.css`: Contains styles for the webpage, providing layout and appearance to the calculator interface.
- `calculator.js`: The main JavaScript logic that calculates the score based on user selections and updates the result dynamically.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple, clean interface that allows users to choose between multiple options for different vulnerability categories.
- **Dynamic Score Calculation**: The score is updated in real-time as users make their selections. A warning is displayed if not all fields are selected.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator adjusts its layout for different screen sizes and provides an optimal user experience on various devices.
- **Validation**: Ensures that all fields are selected before calculating the final score.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Select the appropriate option for each category (e.g., Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Confidentiality Impact, etc.).
3. Once all options are selected, the final score will automatically update in the score box.
4. If any categories are not selected, a warning message will appear prompting the user to complete all fields.

### Categories:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: Choose between Network, Adjacent Network, Local, or Physical.
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Select between Low or High.
- **Privileges Required (PR)**: None, Low, or High.
- **User Interaction (UI)**: None or Required.
- **Scope**: Unchanged or Changed.
- **Confidentiality Impact (Conf)**: None, Low, or High.
- **Integrity Impact (Integ)**: None, Low, or High.
- **Availability Impact (Avail)**: None, Low, or High.
- **Health Impact (Health)**: None, Low, or High.
- **Sensitivity (Sens)**: None, Low, or High.

The score will range between 0 and 10, with 10 indicating the highest level of vulnerability.
